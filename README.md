# dashi: data made delicious
Dashi is dashboard for data visualizations.


## What's underneath the hood?
The dashboard template comes courtesy of [AdminLTE](https://almsaeedstudio.com/themes/AdminLTE/documentation/index.html). AdminLTE is a MIT-licensed, responsive HTML template, which is itself based on the [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

The multidimensional charting comes courtesy of [dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/), an Apache 2.0 licensed JavaScript charting library built on [Crossfilter](https://square.github.io/crossfilter/) and [D3](http://d3js.org/).
